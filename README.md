# Examining Machine Learning Models to predict constituents' voting from the 2016 election. 

## Introduction
In this project I examined data from 'The Views of the Electorate Research (VOTER) Survey' conducted by YouGov. Although the project consists of primarily data from the 2016 election, the respondents were originally interviewed in 2011, 2012, and then in 2016 for a third time. The entire dataset contains responses by 8,000 adults (age 18+) with internet access on 668 questions.

I created 5 different Models-
1. Multinomial logistic regression
2. Regularized Regression w/ Elastic Net
3. Decision Tree 
4. Random Forest 
5. Boosted Tree 

And in depth analyzed the performance on both the training and testing data.

We will find that our best model will be the Regularized Regression w/ an Elastic Net with an accuracy rating of 88% on the training data, and an 87% accuracy rating on the testing data.

## Repository contents
This Project consists of a final_project file, which contains a archive file with the original raw dataset. Then there is a cleaning file that contains some of the scratch work while I was making data decisions. There is a drafts file with all of the drafts from this project, as well as a final_draft project folder that contains the final output, in both html and pdf format. Finally there is a survey_codebook.txt with explantions of all of the variables.
