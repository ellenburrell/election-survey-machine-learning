**Final Project Overview**

**Over View of the data set?**

"The Views of the Electorate Research (VOTER) Survey was conducted by the survey firm YouGov. In total, 8,000 adults (age 18+) with internet access took the survey on-line between November 29 and December 29, 2016. The reported margin of error is plus or minus 2.2%. YouGov also supplied measures of primary voting behavior from the end of the primary period (July 2016), when these respondents had been contacted as part of a different survey project."

**What does it include?**

It includes a 8000 observations of 668 variables, all surrounding a person's political views and who they voted for.

**Where and how will you be obtaining it? Include the link and source.**

I orginally found this data source a couple of years ago on Kaggle. On Kaggle there is also a PDF outlining what each variable stands for.

**About how many observations? How many predictors?**

It includes a 8000 observations of 668 variables, and in my eyes Y would be who the voter voted for, Clinton, Trump, or other. Therefore basically every other question that asks about one's poticial ideology would be a predictor variable.


**What types of variables will you be working with?**

There is basically every type of variable in this data set: binary, numeric, categorical, demographic, etc. 

**Is there any missing data? About how much? Do you have an idea for how to handle it?**

I think basically all of the data is in strings and therefore I will need to convert the numeric data to integers or floats. Besides that I don't think there is any missing data.

**An overview of your research question(s)**

I'm interested in a participants political views/ ideologies affecting or determining who they voted for.

**What variable(s) are you interested in predicting? What question(s) are you interested in answering?**

For now I'm interested in predicting who someone voted for: Trump, Clinton, or other.

**Name your response/outcome variable(s) and briefly describe it/them.**

Right now, there are too many to name but a quick overview would be the participants state, feelings on a particular political figure, answers on a feeling thermometer, ideas for change for a political party, etc. 

**Will these questions be best answered with a classification or regression approach?**

I'm actually not sure, maybe I can get some advice on this one...

**Which predictors do you think will be especially useful?**

I think how someone ranks on the feeling thermometer will be especially useful. 

**Is the goal of your model descriptive, predictive, inferential, or a combination? Explain.**

The goal of my model is predictive. 

**Your proposed project timeline**

I have my data set loaded, so for the next week or so I will focus on exploratory analysis- such as looking into every single one of the 688 variables. Then I will finalize the predictor variables and finalize my research question by the end of week 2 or 3. From there I will work on the model/algorithm as we learn more topics in this class.
